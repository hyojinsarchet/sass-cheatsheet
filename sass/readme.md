# SASS Cheatsheet

### What is SASS?

* Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor. It is to CSS what CoffeeScript is to Javascript. Sass adds a feature set to your stylesheet markup that makes writing styles fun again.

### Features

* Fully CSS-compatible
* Language extensions such as variables, nesting, and mixins
* Many useful functions for manipulating colors and other values
* Advanced features like control directives for libraries
* Well-formatted, customizable output

### How to install

* You need Ruby installed prior to use SASS
* Install SASS (on Mac)
  $sudo gem install sass
* Check the version of the sass
  $ sass --version
* [more info about install](https://sass-lang.com/install)

### Sass vs Scss

* Sass has more simple code like Ruby and Scss is more like CSS. But Scss is more popular and widely used.

### Variables: Sass brings variables to CSS.

* EX)

```
$primaryColor: #eeccff;

body {
    background: $primaryColor
}

$firstValue: 62.5%;
```

```
p {
    font-size: $firstValue
}

$container-width: 100%;

.container {
    width: $container-width;
}
```

### Functions

* One of the best part of Sass is that it's built in functions.
  EX)
  $color: hsl(120deg, 100%, 50%)

* [More examples](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html)

### Nesting

* EX)

```
.container {
    width: 100%;
    h1 {
    color: red;
    }
}
```

### Imports

* It allows you to break your styles into separate files and import them into one another. This does wonders for organization and speed of editing.

* EX)

```
@import "grids.scss";
@import "grids"; (don't even really need the extension)
```

### Extends & Placeholders

* @extend directive is an outstanding way to inherit already existing styles.

  ```
  .input {
      border-radius: 3px;
      border: 4px solid #ddd;
      color: #555;
      font-size: 17px;
      padding: 10px 20px;
      display: inline-block;
      outline: 0;
  }

  .error-input {
      @extend .input;
      border:4px solid #e74c3c;
  }
  ```

### Mixins

* It allows you to include styles the same way @extend would, but with the ability to supply and interperet arguments.

-> This is the most viewed SASS video on Youtube but it was hard for the beginners like me.
I might come back later after learning more.
